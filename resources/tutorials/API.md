# Player manual

### Definitions
* **Media** are the objects that we display.
* **Stimuli** are responsible for how we display the media.
* **Trials** are a set of stimuli and the rules governing their display.


### Media
Media are the objects that we display. We currently support five types of media:

* Plain text: `{word: 'Your very cool stimulus'}`
* Image: `{image: 'some/url/image.png}`
* Jquery elements:` {jquery: $('<div>',{text: 'anything you want' })}`
* HTML: `{html: "<div>any html</div>"}`
* Template:
    * `{template: 'some/url/template.html'}` takes the url of a template file
	* `{inlineTemplate: '<span><%= trialData.name ?></span>'}` takes the literal text of a template

    Templates may include any valid html and [underscore template formating](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#template). (Note: you should always wrap your template inside a single html element).

	Stimuli are passed the trial and stimulus data attributes as "trialData" and "stimulusData" so that you can call:
	```HTML
	<div>
		<%= trialData.name %>
		<span> <%= stimulusData.handle %> </span>
	</div>
	```

If you insert a string instead of a media object the player treats it as if it was Plain text.
The folowing two media definitions have the same outcome:`'Wiki'`, `{word:'Wiki'}`



### Stimuli

Stimuli are responsible for how we present the media.

```js
{
	handle:'myStim',
	size: {height:25,width:25},
	location: {left:25,top:75},
	css:{color:'red','font-size':'2em'},
	media: {word: 'Your very cool stimulus'},
	data: {myData: 'some info', myOtherData: 'some other info'}
	nolog: false
}
```

`handle`:
This is how refer to this specific stimulus inside the player (i.e. if we want to hide or show it). If more than one stimulus (per trial) has the same handle, all actions targeted at that handle will affect all stimuli.
The handle may be set either in the body of the stimulus or inside the data attribute.

`size`:
The size of the stimulus in percentage of the player canvas. By default, size is set to {height:'auto',width:'auto'}.

`location`:
The location to display the stimulus, in percentage of the player canvas. Where `left:20` means that the left border of the stimulus should be 20% from the left of the canvas. You may define any of `left`/`right`/`top`/`bottom` attributes.

Instead of specifying percentages you may use the keyword `center` in order to center the stimulus, or the keyword `auto` in order to override any previous settings.
By default, location is set to `{left:'center', right:'center',top:'center', left:'center'}`.

`css`:
Accepts any jquery css object. (see the [api](http://api.jquery.com/css/) for details)

`media`:
Defines the media associated with this stimulus.

`touchMedia`:
An alternative media object to display in case we are on a touch device (by default, the regular media is used).

`data`:
In addition to the basic attributes of the stimulus you may add any attribute you like as meta deta that will be available from within the player

`nolog`:
If this attribute is set to true, this stimulus (and its associated media) will not be logged.
By default nolog is set to false.


### Trial

Trials are responsible for organizing stimuli and interactions with the user.

```js
{
	data:{my: 'arbitrary',data:'object'},
	layout: [
		stimulus1,
		stimulus2
	],
	input: [
		{handle:'left',on:'leftTouch'},
		{handle:'right',on:'rightTouch'}
	],
	stimuli: [
		stimulus3
	],
	interactions: [
		{
			conditions: [{type:'begin'}],
			actions: [{type:'hideStim',handle:'myStimHandle'}]
		},
		{
			conditions: [{type:'inputEqualsStim',property:'orientation'}],
			actions: [
				{type:'showStim',handle:'myStim'},
				{type:'setInput',input:{handle:'time',on:'timeout',duration:300}}
			]
		},
		{
			conditions: [
				{type:'inputEqualsStim',property:'orientation',negate:true},
				{type:'inputEquals',value:'time',negate:true}
			],
			actions: [{type:'endTrial'}]
		},
		{
			conditions: [{type:'inputEquals',value:'time'}],
			actions: [{type:'hideStim',handle:'myStim'}]
		}
	]
}
```

#### layout / stimuli

The `layout` and `stimuli` are arrays that list the stimuli associated with this trial. Stimuli in `layout` will be statically displayed throughout the trial. stimuli within `stimuli` are not displayed automatically and may be dynamically interacted with during the trial (see interactions).

#### Input

The input attribute lists the input objects that the player reacts to.
Each input object must include both a `handle` and an `on` property.

`handle`: the way we refer to this input element inside the player (e.g., 'rightClick')
`on`: what triggers this input element. for now we have several types of input:

**keypressed**: Takes a `key` property that may either be a key code, a one letter string, or an array of keys.
* `{handle: 'enter',on: 'keypressed',key:'a'}`
* `{handle: 'enter',on: 'keypressed',key:13}`
* `{handle: 'enter',on: 'keypressed',key:[13,'a']}`

**keyup**: Takes a `key` property that may either be a key code, a one letter string, or an array of keys.
* `{handle: 'enter',on: 'keypressed',key:'a'}`
* `{handle: 'enter',on: 'keypressed',key:13}`
* `{handle: 'enter',on: 'keypressed',key:[13,'a']}`

**click**: Takes either a stimulus handle (`stimHandle`) or an html element (`element`) to present, in case an element is defined it is presented as soon as the input is activated.
* `{handle:'right',on:'click',element:$('<div>',css:{})}`
* `{handle:'right',on:'click',stimHandle:'myStimHandle'}`

**timeout**: Takes a `duration` property and fires after the duration passes
* `{handle:'time',on:'timeout',duration:300}`
* `{handle:'time',on:'timeout',duration:[300,600,900]]}` 			pick a random value from an array
* `{handle:'time',on:'timeout',duration:{min:300, max: 900}}}` 		randomly pick from within a range
* `{handle:'time',on:'timeout',duration:function(){return 630}}` 	use a custom function to pick duration

In addition, we have several shortcuts for commonly used inputs:
* `{handle: 'enter',on: 'enter'}`
* `{handle: 'space',on: 'space'}`
* `{handle: 'escape',on: 'esc'}`
* `{handle:'left',on:'leftTouch'}`
* `{handle:'right',on:'rightTouch'}`
* `{handle:'top',on:'topTouch'}`
* `{handle:'bottom',on:'bottomTouch'}`

Protip: In addition to the preset input types you can create custom input:
```js
	{
		handle: 'myInput',
		on: function(callback){
			// do your mojo here and then
			// where e is the raw event, and 'eventType' is the name of this event
			callback(e, 'eventType');
		},
		off: function(){
			// remove your listener (if you need to keep state you can encapsulate the whole input object in a module)
		}
	}
```

The input objects support an additional meta property: `touch`. If touch is undefined then this input will always be used.
If it is set to `true` then the input will be used only on touch devices.
If it is set to `false` then the input will be used only on non touch devices.
* `{handle:'end',on:'bottomTouch',touch:true}`
* `{handle: 'end',on: 'enter', touch:false}`

#### Interactions
Interactions are composed of conditions and actions. Every time an event is fired (any input including timeout or the begining of a trial) all the conditions are evaluated.

The `interactions` array is composed of interaction objects, each holding an array of conditions and an array of actions.
For each interaction object, if all the conditions are true, then all the actions are carried out.

```js
{
	conditions: [
		condition1,
		condition2
	],
	actions: [
		action1,
		action2
	]
}
```
#### Interactions: conditions

Each condition object has a `type` property that defines what type of evaluation to perform.

In addition, it has a `negate` property (false by default) that determines whether to activate the condition when the evaluation is true or when it is false.

**begin**:
Automatically activated at the beginning of the trial, and is never fired again.
* `{type:'begin'}`

**inputEquals**:
Check if the input `handle` equals to a static value, `value` may be either a string or an array strings.
* `{type:'inputEquals',value:'enter'}`
* `{type:'inputEquals',value:['left','right']}`

**inputEqualsGlobal**
Check if the input `handle` equals to the `property` property of the global object.
* `{type:'inputEqualsGlobal',property:'customAttribute'}`

**inputEqualsTrial**:
Check if the input `handle` equals to the `property` property of trial.data
* `{type:'inputEqualsTrial',property:'customAttribute'}`

**inputEqualsStim**:
Check if the input `handle` equals to the `property` property of any one of the stimulus.data in this trial.
The optional property `handle` narrows the search down to stimuli fitting the `handle`
* `{type:'inputEqualsTrial',property:"customAttribute"}`
* `{type:'inputEqualsTrial',property:"customAttribute",handle:'myStimHandle'}`

**trialEquals**:
Check if the `property` property of the trial.data object equals to `value`.
* `{type:'trialEquals',property:'customProperty', value:'someValue'}`

**globalEquals**:
Check if the `property` property of the global object equals to `value`.
* `{type:'globalEquals',property:'customProperty', value:'someValue'}`

**globalEqualsTrial**:
Check if the global property `globalProp` equals to the trial.data property `trialProp`.
* `{type:'globalEqualsTrial',globalProp:'customAttribute', trialProp:'otherCustomAttribute'}`

**globalEqualsStim**:
Check if the global property `globalProp` equals to the `stimProp` property of any one of the stimulus.data in this trial.
The optional property `handle` narrows the search down to stimuli fitting the `handle`
* `{type:'globalEqualsTrial',globalProp:'customAttribute', stimProp:'otherCustomAttribute'}`
* `{type:'globalEqualsTrial',globalProp:'customAttribute', stimProp:'otherCustomAttribute', handle:'myStimHandle'}`


**function**:
It is also possible to create a custom condition:

```js
{type:'function',value:function(trial,inputData){
	// do your mojo here and return true or false
}}
```

It is possible to create complex conditions, the following condition, for instance, is activated in case there is an input that is not equal to trial.data.customAttribute, and the input handle is not "time".
```js
[
	{type:'inputEqualsTrial',property:'customAttribute',negate:true},
	{type:'inputEquals',value:'time',negate:true}
]
```

#### Interactions: actions

If all the conditions in a row of interactions are true, its actions will be executed.

**showStim**:
Display a stimulus, takes a stimulus `handle`. Use 'All' for all stimuli.
* `{type:'showStim',handle:'myStim'}`
* `{type:'showStim',handle:'All'}`

**hideStim**:
Hide a stimulus, takes a stimulus `handle`. Use 'All' for all stimuli.
* `{type:'hideStim',handle:'myStim'}`
* `{type:'hideStim',handle:'All'}`

**setStimAttr**:
Set a stimulus.data attribute, takes a stimulus `handle` and a `setter` object or function.
Any attributes in the setter object will be coppied to the stimulus.data object.
* `{type:'setStimAttr',handle:'myStim',setter:{myAttr:'myValue',myOtherAttr:'myOtherValue'}`
* The setter function:

	```js
	{type:'setStimAttr',handle:'myStim',setter:function(){
		// do your mojo here :)
		// the context ("this") of this function is the stimulus model
	}
	```

**setTrialAttr**:
Set a trial.data attribute, takes a `setter` object or function.
Any attributes in the setter object will be coppied to the trial.data object.
* `{type:'setTrialAttr',setter:{myAttr:'myValue',myOtherAttr:'myOtherValue'}`
* The setter function:

	```js
	{type:'setTrialAttr',setter:function(trialData, eventData){
		// do your mojo here :)
		// trialData is the data object for this trial
		// eventData is the internal event that triggered this action
		// the context ("this") of this function is the trial object
	}
	```

**setGlobalAttr**:
Set a global object property, takes a `setter` object or function.
Any attributes in the setter object will be coppied into the global object.
* `{type:'setGlobalAttr',setter:{myAttr:'myValue',myOtherAttr:'myOtherValue'}`
* The setter function:

	```js
	{type:'setGlobalAttr',setter:function(globalObject){
		// do your mojo here :)
		// globalObject is the global object...
	}
	```

**trigger**:
Activate the input `handle`. If duration is set, the activation happens after the duration. By default the input `handle` is triggered immediately.
* `{type:'trigger',handle : 'now'}`
* `{type:'trigger',handle : 'later',duration:250}`

**setInput**:
Set input listener (useful for adding timeouts), takes an `input` [object](#input-).
* `{type:'setInput',input:{handle:'time',on:'timeout',duration:300}}`

**removeInput**:
Remove input listener, takes an input `handle` or an array of input handles. The special keyword `All` removes all listeners. **Warning** you must add listeners after using removeInput:All, or else the player will get stuck. This command removes triggers as well as regular input listeners.
* `{type:'removeInput',handle : 'time'}`
* `{type:'removeInput',handle : ['time','left']}`
* `{type:'removeInput',handle : 'All'}`

**resetTimer**:
Resets trial timer. The latency of any events from here on (including the current one) will be calculated back to the reset instead of the begining of the trial.
* `{type:'resetTimer'}`

**endTrial**:
*Speaks for itself (note that any actions that come after this is called may not work properly).
* `{type:'endTrial'}`

**log**:
Log this action. Pushes this action into the logging stack so that it is later sent to the server (you can set how the player logs an action using the [logger settings](#logger-))
* `{type:'log'}`

**custom**
Run a custom function. This action is intended to for use by experienced users that want to tinker with the inner workings of the player - use at your own risk! The `fn` property takes a custom function. The function takes two arguments: options is the action object itself, the second is the event data object.
* `{type:'custom',fn:function(options,eventData){}}`

**goto**:
Responsible for the next trial we go to. This action will be executed only after the trial ends, you will probably want to follow it with an endTrial action.

The `destination` property defines what type of goto this is (default is "next").

The `properties` property is an object to compare to the trial data. Note that the properties will only compare to properties present in the raw sequence before inheritance!

* `{type:'goto',destination: 'next'}` goto the next trial (this is the default)
* `{type:'goto',destination: 'current'}` rerun the current trial
* `{type:'goto',destination: 'first'}` goto the first trial
* `{type:'goto',destination: 'last'}` goto the last trial
* `{type:'goto',destination: 'end'}` end this task
* `{type:'goto',destination: 'nextWhere', properties: {blockStart:true}}` goto the next trial that has these properties
* `{type:'goto',destination: 'previousWhere', properties: {blockStart:true}}` goto the previous trial that has these properties


### Inheritance

Each element in the PIP (trial/stimulus/media) can inherit its attributes from an element set.

#### Sets

The element sets are defined in the main task script under `trialSets`/`stimulusSets`/`mediaSets`. Or using using the API using `addMediaSets`/`addStimulusSets`/`addTrialSets`.

Each set is simply an array of elements that can later be referred to as a base for new elements. Note that the name that you give the set (in the example, default or IAT) is the handle that you later use to refer to it.

The examples here use trials as an example, the same principles apply to stimuli and media elements.

```js
var task = {
	// these are the trial sets
	trialSets: {
		// This is the first set, it has only one trial
		default : [
			defaultTrial
		],

		// This is the second set it has three trials
		// The first trial explicitly inherits the default trial and adds some data to it
		IAT : [
			{inherit:{set:default},data:{block:1}},
			block02Trials,
			block03Trials
		]
	},

	// these are the stimulus and media sets
	stimulusSets : stimulusSets,
	mediaSets : mediaSets
}
```

#### Inheriting

When inheriting an element the new element starts out with all of the parent's attributes and extends them with its own.
This means that we use the parent element as a base and then copy in any properties that the child has, overwriting any existing properties.
The only exception to this rule is their `data` objects which we attempt to merge (giving precedence again to the child).

Follow this pseudo code:
```js
// The parent trial
{
	data: {name: 'jhon', family:'doe'}
	stimuli: [
		stim1,
		stim2
	]
}

// The child trial which attempts to inherit the parent
{
	inherit: 'parent',
	data: {name: 'jack'}
	stimuli: [
		stim1
	]
}

// The result would be:
{
	data: {name: 'jack', family:'doe'} 	// the child kept its own name but inherited the family name
	stimuli: [							// the stimuli array was completely overwritten
		stim1
	]
}
```

In order for an element to inherit another element it must use the `inherit` property of the inheriting element.

```js
{
	inherit: inheritObject
}
```

The inherit object has a `set` property defining which element set it should inherit from.
It also has a `type` property that defines what type of inheritance we should use.

We have implemented several types of inheritance:

**random**:
Randomly picks an element from the set. Note that this is the default inheritance type and so it is not obligatory to use the `type` property. You can also use a short cut and set the `set` using a simple string instead of an object (see example below).
* `'setName'`
* `{set: 'setName'}`
* `{set: 'setName', type:'random'}`

**exRandom**:
Picks a random element without repeating the same element until we've gone through the whole set
* `{set: 'setName', type:'exRandom'}`

**bySequence**:
Picks the elements by the order they were inserted into the set
* `{set: 'setName', type:'bySequence'}`

**byData**:
Picks a specific element from the set.
We compare the `data` property to the `element.data` property and if `data` is a subset of `element.data` it picks the element
(this means that if all properties of data property equal to the properties of the same name in element.data it is a fit).
This function will pick only the first element to fit the data.
If the data property is set as a string, we assume it refers to the element handle.

* `{set: 'setName', type: 'byData', data: {block:1, row:2}}` picks the element with both block:1 and row:2
* `{set: 'setName', type: 'byData', data: "myStimHandle"}` picks the element that has the "myStimHandle" handle

**function**:
You may also use a custom function to pick your element.
```js
{set: 'setName', type: function(definitions){
	// definitions is the inherit object (including  set, type, and whatever other properties you'd like to use)
	// the context ("this") is the element collection, it is a Backbone.js collection of the elements in the set
}}
```

#### Customization

Each trial/stimulus/media can also have a customize method, this method is called once the element is inherited but before it is activated.
It accepts two arguments: the source object on which it is called (in this case the appropriate trial object), and the global object. The source object is also the context for the function.
The example shows how you can use customize to push a stimulus into the trial, this allows us to generate stim1 dynamicaly.

```js
{
	inherit: 'something',
	stimuli: [], // note that their are no stimuli yet!
	customize : function(trialSource, globalObject){
		// push a stimulus into the stimulus array
		trialSource.stimuli.push(stim1);
	}
}
```


### The sequence

The sequence is an ordered list of the trials that you want to present consequently to the users.
```js
task = {
	trialSets: trialSets,
	stimulusSets : stimulusSets,
	mediaSets : mediaSets,
	sequence: [
		trial1,
		trial2,
		trial3
	]

}
```

This is all you really need to know in order to run a task. In addition the sequencer provides several mixing options
that allow for powerful randomization of your task.

#### Mixing

The mixer allows wrapping sub sequences in objects that allow you to manipulate the way in which they appear.
You may insert such an object at any place within the sequence and it will be replaced by the appropriate trials.

The basic structure of a mixer object is:
```js
{
	mixer: 'functionType',
	data: [trial1, trial2]
}
```

The `mixer` property holds the mixer type.

The `data` property holds an array of elements (either trials or mixer objects).

A sequence can look something like this (don't get scared it's simpler than it looks):

```js
[
	// The first trial to present.
	firstTrial,

	// Repeat the structure inside 10 time (so we get 40 trials)
	{
		mixer: 'repeat',
		times: 10,
		data: [
			// Delay the mixing of these elements until after the `repeat`.
			{
				mixer: 'wrapper',
				data: [
					trial1,
					// Randomize the order of the trials within.
					{
						mixer: 'random',
						data: [
							trial2,
							// Keep trial 3 and 4 together.
							{
								mixer: 'wrapper',
								data: [
									trial3,
									trial4
								]
							}
						]
					} // end random
				]
			} // end wrapper
		]
	}, // end repeat

	// the last trial to present
	lastTrial
]
```
This sequence has an opening and ending trial (`firstTrial` and `lastTrial`).
Between them them we repeat a set of four trials ten times.
The order of the four trials is randomized, so that `trial1` always comes first and the order of the following trials are randomized but `trial3` and `trial4` are wrapped together and therefore always stay consecutive.

We support several mixer types.

**repeat**:
Repeats the element in `data` `times` times.
* `{mixer:'repeat', times:10, data: [trial1,trial2]}`

**random**:
Randomizes the order of elements in `data`.
* `{mixer:'random', data: [trial1,trial2]}`

**weightedRandom**:
Picks a single element using a weighted random algorithm. Each element in `data` is given the appropriate weight from `weights`. In the following example trial2 has four times the probability of being picked as trial1.
* `{mixer:'weightedRandom', weights: [0.2,0.8], data: [trial1,trial2]}`

**choose**:
Picks `n` random elements from `data` (by default the chooser picks one element).
* `{mixer:'choose', data: [trial1,trial2]}` pick one of these two trials
* `{mixer:'choose', n:2, data: [trial1,trial2,trial3]}` pick two of these three trials

**wrapper**:
The wrapper mixer serves a sort of parenthesis for the mixer. It has two primary functions; first, in case you want to keep a set of elements as a block (when randomizing) simply wrap them and they'll stay together. Second, when repeating a `random` mixer, the mixer first randomizes the content of the inner mixer and only then repeats it. If you want the randomization to be deferred until after the repeat all you have to do is wrap it in a wrapper.
* `{mixer:'wrapper', data: [trial1,trial2]}`


### Changing Settings

Player wide settings are set within the "settings" property of the task JSON.
```js
settings = {
	logger: {
		url: 'your/target/url',
		logger: function(){
			// do your mojo here :)
		}
	},
	canvas: {
		maxWidth: 800,
		proportions : 1
	}
}
```

#### Logger <a href="#logger-"></a>

```js
logger: {
	url: 'your/target/url',
	pulse: 3,
	fullpath: false,
	logger: function(){
		// do your mojo here :)
	}
}
```

The logger section is responsible for logging options.

`url`:
Is the url to which we send the logged data (ask your IT team what it should be). You should set this if you want to log your data...

`pulse`:
After how many rows should we send data to the server.
In case the number of rows is reached during a trial, the player waits until the end of the trial and sends all the log rows it gathered at once.
Regardless of pulse, the player sends all remaining log rows at the end of the task.
This means that it is possible to get pulses holding more or less than "pulse" rows.
If pulse is not set (or is set to 0) the player will send all data at the end of the task.

`fullpath`:
When using the media path to log media elements (for images and templates), should we use the full path or just the filename (`false` by default)

`logger`:
Accepts a function to replace the existing logging function. (don't touch this if you don't **realy** know what you're doing).
The logger function is called each time a log action is triggered (see interactions: actions [log](#interactions-actions)).
It is responsible for adding a logging row to be sent to the server.

```js
function(trialData, inputData, actionData,logStack){
	// trialData: the data object from this trial
	// inputData: the input object that triggered this action
	// actionData: the action object that was triggered (it should look like {type:'log', your:'custom property'})
	// logStack: an array with all previously logged rows

	// the context for this function ("this") is the original trial object

	// the function should return an object to be pushed into the trial stack, and later be sent to the server
}
```

This is what the default logger looks like:
```js
function(trialData, inputData, actionData,logStack){
	var stimList = this._stimulus_collection.get_stimlist();
	var mediaList = this._stimulus_collection.get_medialist();

	return {
		log_serial : logStack.length,
		trial_id: this._id,
		name: this.name(),
		responseHandle: inputData.handle,
		latency: Math.floor(inputData.latency),
		stimuli: stimList,
		media: mediaList,
		data: trialData
	};
};
```

#### Canvas

The canvas section is responsible for the overall look of the player.
It controls the shape and appearance of the canvas.

```js
canvas: {
	maxWidth: 800,
	proportions : 0.8
}
```

`maxWidth`:
The maximum width (in pixels) that the canvas may reach. By default it is set to 500px.

`proportions`:
Responsible for the shape of the canvas. You can set it either as a number or an object. By default it is set to `0.8`.
* `{width:2,height:3}`
* `1.5` calculated as height/width

`textSize`:
Controls the default font size in the canvas. It takes a single number that represents font size in percentage of the canvas height (similar to the CSS3 `vh` unit). By default it is set to 3. Any fontSize within your script that uses a relative unit (percent/em) will be relative to this size. Any fontSize that uses an absolute unit (px/pt) will ignore it.

`background`:
Controls the background color of the whole screen.

`canvasBackground`:
Controls the background color of the player canvas.

`borderWidth`:
Controls the width of the player canvas borders (in pixels).

`borderColor`:
Controls the color of the player canvas borders.

`css`:
Allows you to add any custom css to the canvas (using the jquery css [API](http://api.jquery.com/css/)).

#### Base_url

The `base_url` section is responsible for loading images and templates. It allows the user to pick a base url from which to load all images and templates.
It accepts either an object setting the base url for images and templates or a string that will be used for both images and templates:
```js
// object notation
base_url: {
	image: "images",
	template: "templates/"
}

// string notation
base_url: "media/"
```

#### Redirect

The redirect setting decides where to redirect the player at the end of the task.
By default, the player simply refreshes the current page.
This option is not used if the endTask hook is set.

```js
redirect: '//my.domain.edu'
```

#### Hooks
Hooks are functions that are to be run at predefined points throughout the player.

```js
hooks: {
	endTask: function(){}
}
```

`endTask`:
Called at the end of the task instead of the default redirect.

#### Meta data

Meta data is data that should be returned with every request to the server.
Any key value pair in the meta data is added to every post the player makes to the server.
In order to create a post with three keys: json, session_id and task_id - you would write something like this:

```js
metaData: {
	session_id: 9872356,
	task_id: '43BTW78'
}
```

(the json field is the field that holds the player data it is created automaticaly)



### API

The API is a javascript object that is used to activate the PIP.
The basic format for accessing the API is as follows:

```js
define(['app/API'], function(API) {
	API.addScript(script);
	API.play();
});
```

The API object exposes several helper function to help you organize your script.

**addScript**:
Allows pushing a whole script to the player:
* `API.addScript(script);`

**getScript**:
Returns the whole player script:
* `API.addScript();`

**addGlobal**
Allows extending the global object:
* `API.addGlobal(object);`

	For instance if the current global object looks like this:

	```js
	var globalObject = {
		name: 'Sándor Ferenczi',
		score: '90'
	}
	```

	Then the following script:
	```js
	API.addGlobal({
		score: '100',
		done: true
	})
	```

	Will leave the global object as
	```js
	var globalObject = {
		name: 'Sándor Ferenczi',
		score: '100',
		done: true
	}
	```

**getGlobal**:
Returns the global object:
* `API.getGlobal();`

**addSettings**:
`API.addSettings` allows you to add settings to your script.

You may add a whole settings section:

```js
API.addSettings({
	canvas: {},
	logger: {}
});
```

Alternatively you may add a specific setting:
```js
API.addSettings('canvas',{
	maxWidth: 800,
	proportions : 0.8
});
```

**addTrialSets, addStimulusSets and addMediaSets**:
There are three add set functions, one for each of the set types: `addTrialSets`, `addStimulusSets` and `addMediaSets`.
Each of them allows adding sets to your script.
You may add a complete sets object:

```js
API.addTrialSets({
	Default: [defaultTrial],
	introduction: [intro1, intro2, intro3]
});
```

Or you may add a single set:
```js
API.addTrialSets("introduction",[intro1, intro2]); // adds intro1 and intro2 to the introduction set
```

Or part of a set
```js
API.addTrialSets("introduction",intro3); // adds intro3 to the introduction set
```

**addSequence**
Allows adding sequence objects to your script.

Here is a single set:
```js
API.addSequence([trial1,trial2]);
```

And part of a set:
```js
API.addSequence(trial2);
```

**play**:
Run your task (this function should be run after creating the reset of your script)
* `API.play();`

**getScript**:
Returns the script that you've built so far. Useful mainly for debugging:
* `console.log(API.getScript());`

**getLogs**:
Returns the logs for this task. Useful for giving user feedback or creating staircase tasks
* `console.log(API.getLogs());`

### Logging

The player sends all the data it has gathered to the url defined in the settings [logger](#logger-).
The data is sent as an ajax POST where the only field is "json" (unless you added something using [metadata](#meta-data)).
The field includes a json array including all logs created. each log is an object including the following fields:

Field 			| Description
--------------- |---
log_serial		| the serial number for this log row (starts at 1)
trial_id 		| a unique identifier for this trial
name 			| the name of this trial - an alias if one is set, otherwise the set the trial inherited
block 			| the block attribute of trial.data (it is up to the user to set this attribute, usually in the trial definitions)
responseHandle	| the handle for the input that triggered this log
score 			| the score attribute of trial.data (it is up to the user to set this attribute, usually using setTrialAttr)
latency			| the latency of the response from the beginning of the trial
stimuli 		| a json including the stimuli used in this trial (we use an alias if one is set, otherwise the stimulus set, otherwise the stimulus handle otherwise stim#)
media 			| a json including the media used in this trial (we use an alias if one is set, otherwise the media set, otherwise media#)
data 			| a json including the data property of this trial
