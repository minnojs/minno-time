# Project Implicit Player (PIP)

PI Player builds and runs experiments with time-sensitive tasks over the Internet. It is written in JavaScript and is built to be extremely versatile and customizable.
The scripts for the player are written as JavaScript objects. This format allows, writing simple and straightforward scripts using a constrained scripting language. The format also allows advanced users to easily create complex and dynamic scripts using in-line JavaScript. Full documentation may be found at [our site](http://projectimplicit.github.io/PIPlayer/docs/tutorials/API.html).

### Central Concepts
The player treats each task as a **sequence** of **trials**.

**Trials** do three things:

* Control stimuli presentation
* Evaluate user responses
* Respond to user responses (give feedback, hide a stimulus, finish trial etc.)

Trials are implemented with a **Trial** object. The Trial object is responsible for anything that 'happens' in the trial (e.g., presentation of stimuli). The trial object uses several other objects, the most important of them are the **Stimulus** and the **Media** objects. **Media** objects are responsible for what we show the user (text, images or any other form of media). **Stimuli** objects are the how for the what of the media objects - they control the size, location etc. of their respective media. Each stimulus has one Media object. A Trial object may have multiple stimulus objects.

Trials, Stimuli and Media are the main building blocks of your task. Often, you will want to group them into **Sets**. The Sets are used to organize and randomize their members.

There cannot be more than one trial at a time, and each trial can change just about anything in the player's behavior. The player supports a powerful system for the generation and randomization of trial **sequences**.

* Trials within a sequence may be duplicated, reordered and randomly selected.
* Trials can be created by inheriting some features from another trial.
* Trials may be randomly selected from custom lists (sets).

### Creating a Task

When creating a task you first create your building blocks. You create prototypes for each trial type you intend to use and create sets of stimuli for later use. Next, you drop the building blocks into the sequence; at this stage you decide on the global structure of your task and create the exact randomization that you want.

### Setting up the player

Once your script is ready all you have to do is to call it from within the player index page. i.e.,

```js
require(['js/config'], function() {
  require(['my/path/script.js']);
});
```

Alternatively you can give users a url that directly takes them to your experiment:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>TEST</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a target="_blank" href="../static/src/index.html?url=my/path/script.js">go to my test experiment!</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Collecting the data
All the data that is recorded by the player is sent to a URL of your choosing. Tasks may vary greatly so we give you the flexibility to send whatever data you need and process it however you see fit.

### Building the project
In order to build this project you should install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and then run `npm install` in the root directory.

Next run `npm run build` in order to build the site and optimize the player.

If you want to activate a simple local server run `npm start`.

We use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) in order to automate tasks. `grunt build` should create a dist folder with the optimzed javascript, and a docs folder with documentation. You can specifiy an alternative url for the player using `grunt build --player=path/to/my/player`. You can ask for the site version (as opposed to local version) of the documentation using `grunt build --site`.

### Using PIPlayer in your own project
You can use PIPlayer in your own project by adding it as a Bower dependency. `bower install PIPlayer`.  Please see Bower documentation for additional details on how to setup and use Bower.
 
A note on Bower Dependencies:
 Dependencies should list backbone, jquery, json2, require, among others, but these are loaded by grunt presently, and placed in the dist folder. There are plugins to manage dependencies across grunt and bower. There is a good question on this here:  stackoverflow.com/questions/21198977/difference-between-grunt-npm-and-bower-package-json-vs-bower-json  That suggests that node dependencies are placed in package.json, and other dependencies (jquery etc... should be in the bower.json file).",
